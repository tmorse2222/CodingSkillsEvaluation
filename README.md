User Story:<br>
AS A coding boot camp student<br>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores<br>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers<br>
<br>
Acceptance Criteria:<br>
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz<br>
WHEN I click the start button<br>
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br>
WHEN I answer a question<br>
THEN I am presented with another question<br>
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly<br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br>
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0<br>
THEN the game is over<br>
WHEN the game is over<br>
THEN I can save my initials and score<br>
<br>
This challenge features a coding "game" that was built from scratch. The main feature of the challenge is the use of JavaScript to impact both CSS and HTML to achieve and exceed acceptance criteria.<br>
